<h1>Smooth Convex Hull</h1>

<p>These are two examples of rendering a region around a set of 2D points. I use D3 to get the convex hull, and then
show two different methods to generate a blob around them.


<h2>Rounded Hull</h2>

<p>This technique uses d3.polygonHull, then offsets each segment of the resulting polygon outwards, bridging the gaps
with circular arcs. One could also envision using BÃ©zier curves to get a blob with no straight segments.


<h2>Smooth Hull</h2>

<p>This approach renders a loose enclosing hull around a scattered set of points using a rounded Catmull-Rom curve. The
strict convex hull is offset by a specified amount, and then interpolated with a closed curve.
